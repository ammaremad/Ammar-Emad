# Diabetes Prediction

# Description:
This repository contains code for predicting diabetes using machine learning models. The project utilizes Python along with libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis. Various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, SVC, RandomForestClassifier, and GradientBoostingClassifier are implemented and evaluated for their performance in predicting diabetes. Evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy score, recall score, F1 score, and classification report are used to assess model performance.

# Features:
